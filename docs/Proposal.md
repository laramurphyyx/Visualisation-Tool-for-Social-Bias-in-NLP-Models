## 1    Motivation & Background

Social bias is a very prominent flaw in our society, and despite some recent advancements such as the 'Black Lives Matter' movement, there are still people who hold socially biased views. These biases are often based on stereotypes and prejudices that are systemically maintained, and may be explicit or implicit biases, making the identification and eradication of these harmful views a difficult challenge. Social bias is not limited to a person's race, gender or ethnicity, it can also include age, religion, sexual orientation, physical abilities or even a person's weight. For example, the ACLU found that blacks were 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites in 2010, even though their rate of marijuana usage was comparable. A report carried out by the American Civil Liberties Union shows that black people are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for posession of marijuana than white people (reference). This treatment of black people is explicit discrimination, but discrimination can also be implicit. The University of Virginia carried out a study in 2011 that showed women are 47% more likely to suffer severe injuries in car accidents than men, this is as a result of cars' safety features being designed for men.
