This dataset contains a list of sentence pairs, each having a sentence containing a stereotype/antistereotype and a sentence that does not contain a stereotype/antistereotype.\n",

        "The purpose of this dataset was to evaluate whether language models were more likely to assign a higher probability to the stereotype/antistereotype sentence than to the regular sentence. If you restructure the dataset, and assign each sentence from the sentence pair to be one of 'stereotype', 'antistereotype' or 'not stereotyped', we can fine-tune a multiclass classification BERT model to identify biased sentences. Issues may arise as the classes are not distributed evenly within this dataset. The breakdown is as follows:\n",

If this model classifies the sentence as containing a stereotype or antistereotype, then that sentence can be removed from the training data.
