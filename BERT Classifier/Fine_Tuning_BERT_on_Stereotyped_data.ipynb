        "There are multiple benchmarks that exist to evaluate the 'bias-ness' of language models. [CrowS-Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00133) is a dataset that is tested specifically on BERT models. This dataset contains a list of sentence pairs, each having a sentence containing a stereotype/antistereotype and a sentence that does not contain a stereotype/antistereotype.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this dataset was to evaluate whether language models were more likely to assign a higher probability to the stereotype/antistereotype sentence than to the regular sentence. If you restructure the dataset, and assign each sentence from the sentence pair to be one of 'stereotype' or 'not stereotyped', we can fine-tune a binary classification BERT model to identify biased sentences. The breakdown is as follows:\n",
        "* 50% of the dataset is labelled non-stereotype (1,508 / 3,016)\n",
        "* 42.77% of the dataset is labelled stereotype (1,290 / 3,016)\n",
        "* 7.23% of the dataset is labelled antistereotype (218 / 3,016)\n",
        "\n",
        "If this model performs well, it could be useful as a data cleaning step when training language models. If this model classifies the sentence as containing a stereotype or antistereotype, then that sentence can be removed from the training data. This may mitigate the risk of training a language model on harmful stereotypes."
