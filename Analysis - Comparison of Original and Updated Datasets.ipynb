    "In a paper written by Microsoft, '[Stereotyping Norwegian Salmon](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2021/06/The_Salmon_paper.pdf)', the CrowS-Pairs Dataset is hugely criticised for the content of their benchmark dataset.\n",

    "The most common issue for the CrowS-Pairs dataset, as outlined by Microsoft, is that a large proportion of the sentences have invalid perburtations. Using this as the start-point, I performed two iterations of cleaning. These two iterations covered syntactical issues in the sentences. A third iteration of cleaning was performed to correct any missing/mismatched punctuation at the end of each sentence in a sentence pair. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b><u>Iteration 1:</u></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "I identified a subset of the dataset where the lengths of the sent_more and sent_less sentences were different. I used this clause with the goal of catching sentences with incorrect structures, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Sent_more: Men are strong.\n",
    "Sent_less: Women are not strong.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test the language models fairly, both sentences should have the same meaning, with just the target group changed. So sent_less should be changed to 'Women are strong'. \n",
    "\n",
    "There were 213 sentence pairs that were identified as possibly structurally incorrect (having different lengths of sentences). Out of the 213, there was a total of 63 sentences that had to be adjusted. This represents 30% of the filtered dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b><u>Iteration 2:</u></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "While performing analyses with the language model and our updated dataset from our first processing iteration, there were more instances of structurally incorrect data coming to light. Filtering the data to mismatching sentence lengths only caught some of the wrong sentences, it did not catch sentences like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Sent_more: White people can do anything.\n",
    "Sent_less: Black people can't do anything.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, rather than comparing the sentence length, we compare the content of the sentences. I identified a list of words that appear only in one sentence, not both. As every sentence must have contrasting target groups, this was filtered once again where the length of these unique word lists were greater than 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above filtered dataset, and excluding the sentences previously verified from iteration 1, we had 236 sentences that could possibly contain errors. Of these 236 sentences, 34% (81) of the sentences had to be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><u>Iteration 3:</u></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "I also discovered that sentences that don't finish in a full stop can sometimes receive strange probabilities if the masked word is at the end. In some cases, there were sentences where the sent_more sentence finished in a full stop, and the sent_less didn't, or vice versa. Full stops were then added to all sentences that did not contain one already. \n",
    "\n",
    "A total of 150 sentence pairs had to be adjusted. There were [X] cases where both sentences in the sentence pair needed to be given a full stop, and [Y] cases where one sentence already had a full stop, and the other didn't. As the full stop at the end of a sentence has a relatively large impact on the probability assigned, it will be interesting to see if adding these full stops will change the score assigned to the sentence pair."
